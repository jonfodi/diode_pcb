## Our Expected Result in KiCad

If we pull this off with Zener, it should end up looking like the KiCad schematic below! You can follow along with the [example GitHub directory](https://github.com/diodeinc/example).

The first thing to do is import our dependencies. Diode kindly provides a few generics in the [standard library](https://github.com/diodeinc/stdlib/tree/main/generics) that are very helpful for each of our physical components. Notably, our L Network uses an SMA connector, resistor, capacitor, inductor, ground, and antenna schematic symbol. We can easily import each of these schematics using the built-in `Module()` or `load()` function, coupled with the default package aliases, if the module is already available in the standard library.

However, for both our SMA connector and the antenna, the standard library does not provide a module, so we will need to create a module for each component ourselves.

## Component or Module?
If you check the [Zener module specification](https://docs.pcb.new/pages/spec#files-as-modules), you'll see the following:

>Each `.zen` file is a python module. It can be used in two ways:
>
> 1. Its exported symbols can be `load()`ed into other modules. For example, `load("./MyFile.zen", "MyFunction", "MyType")` will load the `MyFunction` and `MyType` symbols from the `MyFile.zen` module.
> 
> 2. It can be loaded as a schematic module using the `Module()` helper. For example, `MyFile = Module("./MyFile.zen")` will import `MyFile.zen` as a schematic module, which you can instantiate like so:
> 
```python
MyFile = Module("./MyFile.zen")
MyFile(
    name = "MyFile",
    ...
)
```

In short, **a module is defined by a `.zen` file that declares its inputs and creates components**. So, with this knowledge, let's define a component for our SMA connector and antenna.

<Note>The `.zen` file in which we write our component is technically a module. However, since a component must be defined within a `.zen` file, we will consider any file that specifies a component using the `Component()` syntax to be a component itself.</Note>

I'll first make a `components` directory in the root directory, where we can put both of our custom components. 
<Note>It is convention to put the component's `.zen` file inside of another directory with the same component's name</Note>

## Components

Now, if we think logically about a connector, we need one input and one output. What better construct than an `io()` declaration! Before we define our `io()`s, let's first import a ground signal, which is require for the SMA connector to work. Then, let's define our two `io`s for the connector, which by convention will be called `In` and `Ext` with [a type of net](https://docs.pcb.new/pages/spec#net):

```python
load("@stdlib/interfaces.zen", "Ground")

# Declare io
In = io("In", Net) # Convention to name the variable and net the same
Ext = io("Ext", Net)
```

Finally, we'll define a component for our SMA Connector. A component requires a name, footprint, symbol, and pins (which are defined by the symbol). Let's get our schematic symbol from KiCad. If we double-click on the schematic symbol in KiCad, we can see a `Library link: Connector:Conn_Coaxial_Small` in the bottom left. Then, we can [import the symbol with Zener](https://docs.pcb.new/pages/spec#symbol) (notice how we append `.kicad_sym`). We can do something very similarly for the footprint by looking around in `~/Library/Caches/pcb/gitlab/kicad/libraries/kicad-footprints/...`. Last but not least, the standard library provides some layout functionality, so we can see a preview of the layout.

```python
load("@stdlib/properties.zen", "Layout") # Import layout functions from the standard library

Component(
    name = "SMA_Connector",
    footprint = File("@kicad-footprints/Connector_Coaxial.pretty/SMA_Amphenol_132134_Vertical.kicad_mod"),
    symbol = Symbol("@kicad-symbols/Connector.kicad_sym:Conn_Coaxial_Small"),
    pins = {
        "In": In,
        "Ext": Ext
    }
)

Layout(name = "SMA_Connector", path = "build/preview") # Don't use spaces in the name
```

<Tip> Hovering over the pins in a component definition will tell you all the pins Zener expects you to define.
![](/images/Pin_Hints.gif) </Tip>

<Info> There are other definable fields in the component; [check out the spec](https://docs.pcb.new/pages/spec#component)! </Info>

Let's quickly take a look at the whole file before we move on.

```python
load("@stdlib/interfaces.zen", "Ground")
load("@stdlib/properties.zen", "Layout")

In = io("In", Net)
Ext = io("Ext", Net)

Component(
    name = "SMA_Connector",
    footprint = File("@kicad-footprints/Connector_Coaxial.pretty/SMA_Amphenol_132134_Vertical.kicad_mod"),
    symbol = Symbol("@kicad-symbols/Connector.kicad_sym:Conn_Coaxial_Small"),
    pins = {
        "In": In,
        "Ext": Ext
    }
)

Layout(name = "SMA_Connector", path = "build/preview")
```
And the generated output, when clicking on the `pcb: View Schematic` button in VSCode:

![](/images/First_Pass.png)

Pretty close! We might also want to change the prefix from U1 to J1 when we initialize the component. We can improve our `SMAConnector.zen` file by adding a prefix field to the `Component()` function and using a `config`. 

```python
load("@stdlib/interfaces.zen", "Ground")
load("@stdlib/properties.zen", "Layout")

In = io("In", Net)
Ext = io("Ext", Net)

prefix = config("prefix", str, default="J") # [!code ++] Add prefix from config

Component(
    name = "SMA_Connector",
    footprint = File("@kicad-footprints/Connector_Coaxial.pretty/SMA_Amphenol_132134_Vertical.kicad_mod"),
    symbol = Symbol("@kicad-symbols/Connector.kicad_sym:Conn_Coaxial_Small"),
    prefix = prefix, # [!code ++] Initialize component with prefix
    pins = {
        "In": In,
        "Ext": Ext
    }
)

Layout(name = "SMA_Connector", path = "build/preview")
```

![](/images/Second_Pass.png)

Even better!

Similarly, for the antenna:

```python
load("@stdlib/properties.zen", "Layout")

A = io("A", Net)

prefix = config("prefix", str, default="AE")

Component(
    name = "Antenna",
    footprint = File("@kicad-footprints/RF_Antenna.pretty/Texas_SWRA416_868MHz_915MHz.kicad_mod"),
    prefix = prefix,
    symbol = Symbol("@kicad-symbols/Device.kicad_sym:Antenna"),
    pins = {
        "A": A,
    }
)

Layout(name = "Antenna", path = "build/preview")
```

## Modules

While we could just instantiate a resistor, capacitor, inductor, and ground together on our PCB, it would make more sense for our matching network to be a module we can instantiate as a single unit. So, let's make a seperate module for our matching network!

As per usual, let's import the necessary modules we need from the standard library:

```python
load("@stdlib/interfaces.zen", "Ground")
load("@stdlib/properties.zen", "Layout")
```

Then, we can import our specific components for the matching network:

```python
Capacitor = Module("@stdlib/generics/Capacitor.zen")
Inductor = Module("@stdlib/generics/Inductor.zen")
Resistor = Module("@stdlib/generics/Resistor.zen")
```

Let's also define our `io()`s:

```python
io_IN = io("io_IN", Net) # Using "io_" is convention for io()s in modules
io_OUT = io("io_OUT", Net)
io_GND = io("io_GND", Ground)
```

Finally, we will use `Net()`s for internal wires/signals:

```python
L_IN = Net("L_IN")
T = Net("T")
```

<Tip>`io()`s are for signals/wires that need to be accessed by other components or modules, while `Net()`s should be used for internal signals/wires that should not be exposed to external components or modules</Tip>

Now, we can define the connections between our different components for the module by using our `io()`s and `Net()`s we just defined:

```python
Inductor(name = "L1", value = "10nH", package = "0603", P1 = io_IN, P2 = T) # Using placeholder values for value and package
Capacitor(name = "C1", value = "10pF", package = "0603", P1 = T, P2 = io_GND)
Resistor(name = "R1", value = "100ohm", package = "0603", P1 = T, P2 = io_OUT)
```

Finally, we'll add a `Layout()` function, so the user can view the layout of the module in KiCad:

```python
Layout(name = "MatchingNetwork", path = "layout/MatchingNetwork")
```

Let's take a look at the whole module before making our PCB:

```python
load("@stdlib/interfaces.zen", "Ground")
load("@stdlib/properties.zen", "Layout")

Capacitor = Module("@stdlib/generics/Capacitor.zen")
Inductor = Module("@stdlib/generics/Inductor.zen")
Resistor = Module("@stdlib/generics/Resistor.zen")

io_IN = io("io_IN", Net)
io_OUT = io("io_OUT", Net)
io_GND = io("io_GND", Ground)

L_IN = Net("L_IN")
T = Net("T")

Inductor(name = "L1", value = "10nH", package = "0603", P1 = io_IN, P2 = T)
Capacitor(name = "C1", value = "10pF", package = "0603", P1 = T, P2 = io_GND)
Resistor(name = "R1", value = "100ohm", package = "0603", P1 = T, P2 = io_OUT)

Layout(name = "MatchingNetwork", path = "layout/MatchingNetwork")
```

## PCB

As we've done for both our custom components and modules, let's import the necessary standard library functions into `EX0001.zen`:

```python
load("@stdlib/interfaces.zen", "Ground")
load("@stdlib/properties.zen", "Layout")
```

Let's import our custom modules and components:

```python
MatchingNetwork = Module("//modules/MatchingNetwork.zen")
Antenna = Module("//components/Antenna/Antenna.zen")
SMA_Connector = Module("//components/SMAConnector/SMAConnector.zen")
```

We should also define our `Net()`s:

```python
IN = Net("IN")
OUT = Net("OUT")
GND = Ground("GND") # Ground is a special type of Net
```

Finally, our connections as well as the layout:

```python
Antenna(name = "Antenna", A = OUT)
MatchingNetwork(name = "MatchingNetwork", io_IN = IN, io_OUT = OUT, io_GND = GND)
SMA_Connector(name = "SMA_Connector", In = IN, Ext = GND)

Layout(name = "Antenna_LRC_Matcher", path = "build/preview")
```

After rotating and moving the rendered schematic components, just as you would with KiCad, here is the result:

![](/images/Zener_L_Network.png)

You've created a functional schematic with Zener!

## Bonus

We can also programmatically add mounting holes with Zener:

```python
load("@stdlib/interfaces.zen", "Ground")
load("@stdlib/properties.zen", "Layout")

MatchingNetwork = Module("//modules/MatchingNetwork.zen")
Antenna = Module("//components/Antenna/Antenna.zen")
SMA_Connector = Module("//components/SMAConnector/SMAConnector.zen")

IN = Net("IN")
OUT = Net("OUT")
GND = Ground("GND")

Antenna(name = "Antenna", A = OUT)
MatchingNetwork(name = "MatchingNetwork", io_IN = IN, io_OUT = OUT, io_GND = GND)
SMA_Connector(name = "SMA_Connector", In = IN, Ext = GND)

MountingHole = Module("@stdlib/generics/MountingHole.zen") # [!code ++] Import mounting holes from the standard library

for i in range(4): # [!code ++] Generate four mounting holes
    MountingHole(name = "H" + str(i), diameter = "M2") # [!code ++] 

Layout(name = "Antenna_LRC_Matcher", path = "build/preview")
```

We can then finish up the layout and routing inside of KiCad:
